# Phase 3 - Interactive Prototype

## Overview

Create an interactive prototype (i.e., the prototype should be digitally interactive making it possible for a user to interact with it). You may use any development medium of your choice (JavaScript, HTML, Balsamiq, PowerPoint, Axure, JustInMind, etc.). The working prototype should allow users to accomplish at least three tasks. These tasks should be related to your findings from Phase I and Phase II and should lead you to the next phase of the project where you will be evaluating this interactive prototype in a controlled environment.


## Requirements

A written report containing the following information:

1. Group name and members of the group.

2. A file or a website URL of your interactive prototype.

3. A description of the three tasks along with step-by-step instructions on how a user can accomplish
these tasks using your interactive prototype.

4. Provide a 1-page description (few paragraphs) of how you plan to evaluate the three tasks in the
next phase of the project (Phase IV).
