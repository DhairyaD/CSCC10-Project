# Phase 4 - Usability Evaluation and Final Report

## Overview

Each group will design a user study to evaluate their interactive prototype (Phase III) and the three tasks that the interface can accomplish. In order to evaluate your prototype, you may choose one of the following:

1. Interviews (3 participants with 30 minutes each);
2. Questionnaires (8-10 participants);
3. Focus groups (5 participants).

All usability studies must be conducted by classmates (excluding the group members). A consent form is required from each participant 

The results should be analyzed (qualitatively, quantitatively or both) and described in the final report along with limitations and future work. 

## Requirements

A final report should meet conference submission standards (i.e., CHI) - minimum 4 pages and maximum 6 pages:

1. Sections to include: Abstract, Introduction, Literature Review, Problem Statement/Research Question, Gathering of User Requirements, Prototype, Usability Study, Results from Data Analysis, Limitations, Future Work and References.

	- Abstract: refer to CHI papers

	- Introduction, Literature Review, Problem Statement/research question, Gathering of User Requirement and Prototype

	- Usability Study: describe which method was chosen and why. Provide details about the design of your usability study and the environment in which the study was conducted. Describe the tasks that were evaluated and how.

	- Results: analyze the results from the usability study and present your findings including the number of participants. You can use tables and charts to describe your findings and explain it in this section.

	- Limitations: describe any limitations of the study.
	
	- Future Work section should include the improvements you would make to your prototype based on the results from the usability study. You do not need to implement the improvements but you must state all improvements based on your findings from the usability study. In addition, describe further work that can be accomplished in a broader level (for example, further studies can be conducted to examine the new interfaceâ€™s usage on small screen devices).

2. As appendices, include the artifacts used to conduct the usability evaluation (sample informed consent, sample interview questions, questionnaires, focus group questions, along with your notes from all interview sessions, your notes from focus groups).
