# Phase 1

## Proposal

The proposal consists of:

1. A brief description and purpose of the selected interface/website/application or a brand new interface/website/application (i.e., why is it important? what is the problem? why it is a problem?)

2. The target audience (users) of the interface/website/application.

3. Propose specific changes to existing interface/website/application to solve the problem or describe
how the brand new interface will meet a need. Briefly explain why it is believed that they will
work. Use examples/screenshots of existing interfaces, if necessary, as Appendices.

4. Literature review to back-up your proposal (at least 5 academic citations are required).
